# Optimizing Evacuation Routes using Real-Time Traffic Information

## Overview

During disasters, search and rescue teams must be able to search for and get to survivors as fast as possible (in terms of travel time and distance). Current GIS and navigation systems allow responders to calculate travel time and distance between origin and destination, and propose an optimal route to the destination. However, many of the current platforms do not rely on real-time data (e.g. road closures, damaged roads etc.) and can produce inaccurate or inefficient results.

This project will leverage social media, news feeds and other datasets (e.g. Waze, Here.com) to identify real time road closures or damaged roads, power outages and other blocked routes that may affect traffic lights, travel time, travel safety and more.
